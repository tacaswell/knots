Demos
=====

Reflection Knots
----------------

These are curves made by reflecting a "unit cell" to generate the complete knot

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/knots/demos.py
   :pyobject: knot1

.. plot:: demos.py demo_knot1


Bands
-----

Running linear bands inspired by page boarders.  In principle these should be
tiled from one unit, but are currently just fixed length (and bigger than the view)

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/knots/demos.py
   :pyobject: band1


.. plot:: demos.py demo_band1

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/knots/demos.py
   :pyobject: band2


.. plot:: demos.py demo_band2



Rings
-----


.. literalinclude:: ../../src/knots/demos.py
   :pyobject: ring1


.. plot:: demos.py demo_ring1

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/knots/demos.py
   :pyobject: ring2


.. plot:: demos.py demo_ring2
