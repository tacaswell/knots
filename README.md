# Knots

Based on _Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction_ [^book], which covers how to
create Celtic-style knot work this code automates the initial steps for basic
knots.

Very briefly, the method is to:

1. construct a single line that is the path of the knot
2. expand to a ribbon around the center line
3. interleave the crossings
4. elaboration

Using this code you will be able to generate up to stage 2 that can be printed
and traced.
